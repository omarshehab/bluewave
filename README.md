2. graph-isomorphism-quantum-annealing - This project is developing a Python implementation of the Lucas-Zick-Shehab quantm
   annealing algorithm for graph isomorphism.
3. image-segmentation-quantum-annealing - This project is developing a quantum annealing algorithm for image segmentation.
4. markov-random-field - Similar to # 3.
5. nasa-aist-grant-codes - Source code for the NASA-AIST 2014 grant.
